# Eval Guide

How to write eval criteria that actually improve your skills instead of giving you false confidence.

## The Golden Rule

Every eval must be a **yes/no question**. Not a scale. Not a vibe check. Binary.

Why: Scales compound variability. If you have 4 evals scored 1-7, your total score has massive variance across runs. Binary evals give you a reliable signal.

## Good Evals vs Bad Evals

### Text/Copy Skills (newsletters, tweets, emails, landing pages)

**Bad evals:**
- "Is the writing good?" (too vague — what's "good"?)
- "Rate the engagement potential 1-10" (scale = unreliable)
- "Does it sound like a human?" (subjective, inconsistent scoring)

**Good evals:**
- "Does the output contain zero phrases from this banned list: [game-changer, here's the kicker, the best part, level up]?" (binary, specific)
- "Does the opening sentence reference a specific time, place, or sensory detail?" (binary, checkable)
- "Is the output between 150-400 words?" (binary, measurable)
- "Does it end with a specific CTA that tells the reader exactly what to do next?" (binary, structural)

### Visual/Design Skills (diagrams, cards, slides)

**Bad evals:**
- "Does it look professional?" (subjective)
- "Rate the visual quality 1-5" (scale)
- "Is the layout good?" (vague)

**Good evals:**
- "Is all text in the image legible with no truncated or overlapping words?" (binary, specific)
- "Does the color palette use only the defined design tokens with no off-palette colors?" (binary, checkable)
- "Is the layout linear — flowing either left-to-right or top-to-bottom with no scattered elements?" (binary, structural)
- "Are all images exactly the specified dimensions?" (binary, measurable)

### Code/Technical Skills (code generation, configs, scripts)

**Bad evals:**
- "Is the code clean?" (subjective)
- "Does it follow best practices?" (vague, which best practices?)

**Good evals:**
- "Does the code run without errors?" (binary, testable — actually execute it)
- "Does the output contain zero TODO or placeholder comments?" (binary, greppable)
- "Are all function and variable names descriptive (no single-letter names except loop counters)?" (binary, checkable)
- "Does the code include error handling for all external calls (API, file I/O, network)?" (binary, structural)

### Document Skills (proposals, reports, summaries)

**Bad evals:**
- "Is it comprehensive?" (compared to what?)
- "Does it address the client's needs?" (too open-ended)

**Good evals:**
- "Does the document contain all required sections: [list them]?" (binary, structural)
- "Is every claim backed by a specific number, date, or source?" (binary, checkable)
- "Is the document under [X] pages/words?" (binary, measurable)
- "Does the executive summary fit in one paragraph of 3 sentences or fewer?" (binary, countable)

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Many Evals

More than 6 evals and the skill starts gaming them — it optimizes for passing the test instead of producing good output. Like a student who memorizes answers without understanding the material.

**Fix:** Pick the 3-6 checks that matter most. If everything passes those, the output is probably good.

### 2. Too Narrow / Too Rigid

"Must contain exactly 3 bullet points" or "Must use the word 'because' at least twice" — these create skills that technically pass but produce weird, stilted output.

**Fix:** Evals should check for qualities you care about, not arbitrary structural constraints.

### 3. Overlapping Evals

If eval 1 is "Is the text grammatically correct?" and eval 4 is "Are there any spelling errors?" — these overlap. A grammar fail often includes spelling. You're double-counting.

**Fix:** Each eval should test something distinct.

### 4. Unmeasurable by an Agent

"Would a human find this engaging?" — an agent can't reliably answer this. It'll say "yes" almost every time.

**Fix:** Translate subjective qualities into observable signals. "Engaging" might mean: "Does the first sentence contain a specific claim, story, or question (not a generic statement)?"

## Writing Your Evals: The 3-Question Test

Before finalizing an eval, ask:

1. **Could two different agents score the same output and agree?** If not, the eval is too subjective. Rewrite it.
2. **Could a skill game this eval without actually improving?** If yes, the eval is too narrow. Broaden it.
3. **Does this eval test something the user actually cares about?** If not, drop it. Every eval that doesn't matter dilutes the signal from evals that do.

## Template

Copy this for each eval:

```
EVAL [N]: [Short name]
Question: [Yes/no question]
Pass: [What "yes" looks like — one sentence, specific]
Fail: [What triggers "no" — one sentence, specific]
```

Example:

```
EVAL 1: Text Legibility
Question: Is all text in the output fully legible with no truncated, overlapping, or cut-off words?
Pass: Every word is complete and readable without squinting or guessing
Fail: Any word is partially hidden, overlapping another element, or cut off at the edge
```

## Eval Presets by Skill Type

### News Card Skill (`skills/news-card/`)

```
EVAL 1: Card Count
Question: Does the run produce exactly 8 PNG files?
Pass: 8 PNG files in images/ directory
Fail: Not exactly 8 files

EVAL 2: Correct Dimensions
Question: Are all PNGs 2160×3840 pixels?
Pass: Every PNG is exactly 2160×3840px
Fail: Any PNG has different dimensions

EVAL 3: Tier Distribution
Question: Does digest.json have 4 tier-1 + 4 tier-2 + 8 tier-3 = 16 items?
Pass: Correct count per tier
Fail: Wrong distribution

EVAL 4: Serif Fonts Only
Question: Do all HTML files use only serif fonts?
Pass: Zero sans-serif declarations
Fail: Any sans-serif font found

EVAL 5: Category Colors Match
Question: Does every color_tag match its category per design-tokens.md?
Pass: All mappings correct
Fail: Any category-color mismatch

EVAL 6: No Template Artifacts
Question: Are output HTML files free of raw {{...}} template tags?
Pass: Zero template syntax in rendered HTML
Fail: Any unrendered template tag found
```
